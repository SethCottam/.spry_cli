		+ Install the ascii art command into the proper section
	- Format the README.md
  - Need to build out a CLI help response for Spry CLI

- Plugins (_For all the stuff we want it to be able to do_)
- System (_Core system shells that shouldn't be messed with and core shell dependancies_)

## Notes


#### Directories

+ development _This stores files specific to managing local development_
+ installation _Installation shells_
+ output _Shells for managing formatting and coloration of the Spry CLI terminal outputs_
+ safehouse _This is where you store secrets needed by your user settings and/or spryts. These ARE NOT tracked by git._
+ spryts _A play on Spry, this is where you store each individual script/plugin that you want to autoload into the Spry CLI_
+ system _System specific shells for managing the build and implementation of the Spry CLI_



#### Load Order
+ autoloader.sh
+ development/master_constroller.sh
  - Output shell scripts
  - Spryts shell scripts
  - System shell scripts
  - The remaining development shell scripts
  - User specific scripts



#### Git considerations
_For ignoring all future changes to a file AFTER this point_
_This is useful for initial config files that you expect a user to change_
`git update-index --skip-worktree path/DummyFile.txt`



#### Ascii Art Intro
I changed the plugins folder to spryts because I like the word play!

Handling arg options

You can pass multiple arrays as arguments using something like this:
```bash
takes_ary_as_arg()
{
    declare -a argAry1=("${!1}")
    echo "${argAry1[@]}"

    declare -a argAry2=("${!2}")
    echo "${argAry2[@]}"
}
try_with_local_arys()
{
    # array variables could have local scope
    local descTable=(
        "sli4-iread"
        "sli4-iwrite"
        "sli3-iread"
        "sli3-iwrite"
    )
    local optsTable=(
        "--msix  --iread"
        "--msix  --iwrite"
        "--msi   --iread"
        "--msi   --iwrite"
    )
    takes_ary_as_arg descTable[@] optsTable[@]
}
try_with_local_arys
```

will echo:
```bash
sli4-iread sli4-iwrite sli3-iread sli3-iwrite
--msix  --iread --msix  --iwrite --msi   --iread --msi   --iwrite
```


#### Brand new mac install

Might want to allow for an unprotected prer

+ Setup SSH Key (Then add in the remote repo)... might just do this as a password the first time then switch to ssh. Or might allow the prerunner to be a public repo?
+ Needs to install mac developer tools. (Dependancy for a git install)
+ git clone ... (Spry CLI needs to be the old repo)
+ Needs an installer for .zsh to append the autoloader to the .zshrc file

#### Package Management
_General Ideas - Very much a work in progress_

Each file is their own sub_repo ie_spry/spryts/spryt_name?

Spry CLI should be it's own repo
The spryts are individual

Switch to git pull only, running on production

We need to create a spryts whitelist rather than a .ignore based blakclist
  - We should probably have a blanket .ignore for the ENITRE Spryts directory
  - We should add a config (to add additional )
